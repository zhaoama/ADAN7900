Major tasks
1. Propose a research topic
- Our project aims to analyze the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of liquor consumption in Iowa, exploring two main research questions:
a. Economic and Socio-Demographic Determinants: Is there a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and factors, such as unemployment rate, income, and education levels across Iowa cities? (will be mainly focused for checkpoint 1)
b. Racial Group Analysis: How does alcohol consumption vary across racial groups in Iowa cities? Are there unique patterns in alcohol consumption among racial groups under specific economic or educational conditions?

2. Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration
- Repository: We will create a GitHub repository to host all resources, datasets, code, and analysis documentation. This will serve as the central hub for our work and ensure transparency and accessibility.
- Folder Structure: Organized by data source, analysis scripts (R notebooks/Markdown), following a clear and consistent structure for easy navigation.
- Version Control: Each team member will work on separate branches and merge contributions through pull requests, ensuring that code reviews and testing precede all main-branch merges.
- Weekly Check-ins: We will discuss progress and insights weekly, share ongoing findings, address any blockers, and outline the next steps. This will help us meet project milestones on time and ensure even contributions from all team members. Prepare initial findings to discuss during team meetings and receive feedback for improvement.

3. Demonstrate merging of multiple data sources
- We will use multiple data sources:
a. Iowa Liquor Sales for alcohol consumption patterns, across alcohol categories
b. American Community Survey (ACS) for socioeconomic and demographic data, including income, education, and racial composition, across Iowa cities.

- Data Merging Steps:
a. Data Cleaning: Standardize each dataset by handling missing values, aligning formats, and preparing consistent geographic identifiers for merging.
b. Data Integration: Merge the datasets at the city/county & zipcode level for consistency, ensuring temporal alignment where applicable.
c. Documentation: Each team member will document their data preparation steps in shared R workbooks to maintain transparency.

- Visualize data using Tableau, R, Python, or a combination
a. Conduct an initial EDA to explore correlations and trends in alcohol consumption related to socioeconomic and demographic factors.
b. Visualize relationships using R and Tableau, depending on suitability for the specific analysis. This would include a basic data table view (summary/view/head), to have a better understanding of our data structure; Histogram/bar chart (e.g., top X sales of alcohol categories) for exploring interesting patterns for target variable (alcohol consumption) and other factors (unemployment rate, income, and education level); Correlation plotted by correlation heatmap among target variable (alcohol sales) and factors
(e.g., unemployment rate, income, and education level, category); Scatterplot along with suitable fitting line to see the trend of Sales over time (across years, by volume & $), and top sales of alcohol categories; a simple geographic map on Tableau marking the variation in sales in different area across counties, cities as the different layers in Iowa.


4. Generate meaningful summary statistic (KPIs) of the data
- We will calculate and present summary statistics, such as average alcohol consumption per capita, income distribution, and unemployment rate by city/county and racial group.
- Then, we will use these KPIs to highlight significant trends and relationships within the data.
