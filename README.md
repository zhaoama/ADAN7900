## Discussion of progress on the eight major tasks. 
**1. Propose a research topic:**
Our project aims to analyze the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of liquor consumption in Iowa, exploring two main research questions:
-  Economic and Socio-Demographic Determinants: Is there a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and factors, such as unemployment rate, income, and education levels across Iowa cities? **(Partially revised after discussion of problems)**
-  Racial Group Analysis: How does alcohol consumption vary across racial groups in Iowa cities? Are there unique patterns in alcohol consumption among racial groups under specific economic or educational conditions?**(Will be mainly focused for checkpoint 2)**

**2. Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration**
-  _Repository:_ We will create a GitHub repository to host all resources, datasets, code, and analysis documentation. This will serve as the central hub for our work and ensure transparency and accessibility.
-  _Folder Structure:_ Organized by data source, analysis scripts (R notebooks/Markdown), following a clear and consistent structure for easy navigation.
-  _Version Control:_ Each team member will work on separate branches and merge contributions through pull requests, ensuring that code reviews and testing precede all main-branch merges.
-  _Weekly Check-ins:_ We will discuss progress and insights weekly, share ongoing findings, address any blockers, and outline the next steps. This will help us meet project milestones on time and ensure even contributions from all team members. Prepare initial findings to discuss during team meetings and receive feedback for improvement.

**3. Demonstrate merging of multiple data sources**
We will use multiple data sources:
-  Iowa Liquor Sales for alcohol consumption patterns, across alcohol categories
-  American Community Survey (ACS) for socioeconomic and demographic data, including income, education, and racial composition, across Iowa cities.

**4.  Visualize data using Tableau, R, Python, or a combination**
Conduct an initial EDA to explore correlations and trends in alcohol consumption related to socioeconomic and demographic factors.
Visualize relationships using R and Tableau, depending on suitability for the specific analysis.
-  Add a basic data table view (summary/view/head), to have a better understanding of our data structure.
-  Histogram/bar chart (e.g., top X sales of alcohol categories)
-  Correlation (correlation heatmap)
-  Scatterplot & fitting line
-  Conducting a simple geographic map on Tableau

**5. Generate meaningful summary statistic (KPIs) of the data**
Calculate and present summary statistics, such as average alcohol consumption per capita, income distribution, and unemployment rate by city/county and racial group.
Use KPIs to highlight significant trends and relationships within the data.

**6. Submit draft of progress at Chekpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2**

**7. Summmarize your findings in a short video presentation**

**8. Publish a detailed, well formatted markdown report of your analytical story to your GitHub reposity.**

## Challenges and victories of collaborating on GitHub.

## Report the individual contributions of each team member. The latest working files should be pushed to the GitHub Repository.
