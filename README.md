## Discussion of progress on the eight major tasks. 
**1. Propose a research topic:**
Our project aims to analyze the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of liquor consumption in Iowa, exploring two main research questions:
-  Economic and Socio-Demographic Determinants: Is there a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and factors, such as unemployment rate, income, and education levels across Iowa cities? **(Partially revised after discussion of problems)**
-  Racial Group Analysis: How does alcohol consumption vary across racial groups in Iowa cities? Are there unique patterns in alcohol consumption among racial groups under specific economic or educational conditions?**(Will be mainly focused for checkpoint 2)**

**2. Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration**
-  _Repository:_ We continue using GitHub repository to host all resources, datasets, code, and analysis documentation. This will serve as the central hub for our work and ensure transparency and accessibility.
-  _Folder Structure:_ Organized by data source, analysis scripts (R notebooks/Markdown), following a clear and consistent structure for easy navigation.
-  _Version Control:_ Each team member will work on separate branches and merge contributions through pull requests, ensuring that code reviews and testing precede all main-branch merges.
-  _Weekly Check-ins:_ We will discuss progress and insights weekly, share ongoing findings, address any blockers, and outline the next steps. This will help us meet project milestones on time and ensure even contributions from all team members. Prepare initial findings to discuss during team meetings and receive feedback for improvement.

**3. Demonstrate merging of multiple data sources**
We will use multiple data sources:
-  Iowa Liquor Sales for alcohol consumption patterns, across alcohol categories
-  American Community Survey (ACS) for socioeconomic and demographic data, including income, education, and racial composition, across Iowa cities.

**4.  Visualize data using Tableau, R, Python, or a combination**
Conduct an initial EDA to explore correlations and trends in alcohol consumption related to socioeconomic and demographic factors.
Visualize relationships using R and Tableau, depending on suitability for the specific analysis.
-  Scatterplot of race and alcohol consumption
-  Scatterplot of the trivariate relationship between race, education and alcohol consumption
-  Correlation (correlation heatmap)

**5. Generate meaningful summary statistic (KPIs) of the data**
Calculate and present summary statistics, such as average alcohol consumption per capita, income distribution, and unemployment rate by city/county and racial group.
Use KPIs to highlight significant trends and relationships within the data.

**6. Submit draft of progress at Chekpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2**

**7. Summmarize your findings in a short video presentation**

**8. Publish a detailed, well formatted markdown report of your analytical story to your GitHub reposity.**

## Potential policy recommendations.
### Decision-making in response to economic and socio-demographic determinants
**Prioritize allocation of funds:**
-  Prioritize the allocation of funds to cities with high unemployment rates and significant alcohol consumption, especially in areas where low-income populations are concentrated.
-  Create scholarships or vocational education funds to help raise the educational level of low-education city residents.

**Targeted tax policies:**
-  Increase alcohol taxes in high-consumption areas while providing subsidies for community development (e.g., improving job training centers or educational infrastructure).
-  Propose a “specific purpose excise tax” model that identifies alcohol tax revenues to support socio-economic issues.

**Promote healthy lifestyles:**
-  Promote city-level community wellness programs, including free exercise spaces and mental health support services, as an alternative to high alcohol consumption recreational habits.

### Decision Making for Racial Group Analysis
**Diversity community support:**
-  Establish culturally and racially sensitive public health and social service centers that provide targeted guidance, such as sobriety programs or financial help.
-  Collaborate with leaders in racially diverse communities to design and implement alcohol consumption reduction programs, ensuring that programs are culturally relevant.
-  Increase resources for communities with minority groups to reduce educational and income disparities.
-  Provide business incubator programs to support minority entrepreneurship and increase economic self-sufficiency.

## Report the individual contributions of each team member. 
-  Jinglei Chen: Jinglei created a map of alcohol sales across Iowa cities, by using wine category as a filter. Her next step is to create a map that can plot sum alcohol sales (in colors & sizes) across Iowa cities, by switching between each racial group (seeking advice from Prof.)
-  Yifei Li: Yifei created scatterplot of the trivariate relationship between race, education and alcohol consumption. Result can be found in "Yifei's Analysis 2"
